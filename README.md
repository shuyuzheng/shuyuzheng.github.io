# Shuyu's Blog

I have been planning to build up my own blog for several monthes from 2018.10 science I realized the inportance of a blog to geeks. I have tried several different methods, such as jekyll, hugo, and R blogdown, but didn't get any idea of how my blog should be. 

The time went to 2018.12.15. I attended a "Mini Hackthon" hosted by "Girl coding club" and I write the first webpage in my life from scratch by myself (although with a lot of help from coaches). As long as finishing the "Hackthon", I dicided to use it as the home page of my blog. But there are two choices: 

1. Using blog engine to generate a frame and then replacing the home page with my webpage.
2. Building all elements of my blog by myself.

Finally I pick up the second one, because I think it could help me learn more about website developing. Of course, I need to pay more time and effort on this decision, but anyway **Just do it!**
